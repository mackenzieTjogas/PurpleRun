# PurpleRun
Senior Project for 402  
  
PurpleRun is a domestic violence iOS app. It will be a resource for survivors of domestic abuse, as well as a resource to help educate anyone who wants to learn more about this issue and help the cause. Note this app will provide information for survivors and allies **who are in the United States**. The app is careful to avoid raising any suspicion from an abuser, with a game-like name and homescreen. A password will be needed to get to the “real” homepage of the app. Every page of the app will have an emergency button that will immediately call 911. The app will be a source of information, giving users the opportunity to select from the main menu information on: how to be an advocate, education on the different types of abuse, general legal information, what to do if you are an undocumented survivor, what to do if you are a survivor with children, and shelters in your area. The app will also have different language options as well as information on interpreters. The user only needs internet access and a smartphone. 

Please note: This app does not use Apple's new "Emergency SOS" feature because it is triggered in different ways for different iPhone versions and requires a software update to iOS 11. This app is intended to be as simple as possible for users who have differing levels of familiarity with iPhones, and since the Emergency SOS feature is relatively new, it is unlikely that all users would know what it is (or feel comfortable using it). Likewise, it is unknown how many users will have done the  software update to iOS 11 before using PurpleRun. Additionally, this app does not require users to make accounts. Research shows that this can make a user less likely to use a resource if they fear they will be caught. Even if the threat is nonexistent and making an account will not cause them to recieve emails (or leave any other trail of suspicion), the fear itself may deter users from using the app.
