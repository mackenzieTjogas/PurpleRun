# 2.0 Preliminary Project Proposals

1. Domestic Violence App
<p>PurpleRun is a domestic violence app. It will be a resource for survivors, as well as a resource to help educate anyone who wants to learn more about this issue and help the cause. The app has a game-like name to avoid causing any suspicions from the abuser. The homepage will appear as a game and a pin will be needed to get to the “real” homepage of the app. Every page of the app will have an emergency button that will immediately call 911 and the call won't be ended unless the user’s pin is entered.The app will have a main menu page with option for all of the information it will have: how to be an advocate/ally (which will explainhow to help, where to volunteer, what to know, etc.), information on different types of abuse, general info for all survivors (legal, health, etc.), information for undocumented survivors, information for mothers/survivors with children, and shelters in the user’s local area with their contact information. The app will also have different language options as well as information on interpreters.</p>

2. Bored & Broke (continuation fo 401)
<p>A possible extension of the current features available on last semester's application, or the possibility of turning Bored&Broke into a mobile app.</p>
