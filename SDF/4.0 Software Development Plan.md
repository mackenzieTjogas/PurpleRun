# 4.0 Software Development Plan
  
### 4.1   Plan Introduction  
This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the PurpleRun iOS app which provides an application that provides information and resources to domestic violence survivors and those who want to educate themselves on the issue.  
  
Domestic violence affects nearly 20 people per minute in the United States (https://ncadv.org/statistics). PurpleRun aims to both educate society on this epidemic, as well as provide resources and information for survivors of intimate partner violence.  
  
PurpleRun is a domestic violence iOS app. It will be a resource for survivors of domestic abuse, as well as a resource to help educate anyone who wants to learn more about this issue and help the cause. The app is careful to avoid raising any suspicion from an abuser, with a game-like name and homescreen. A pin will be needed to get to the “real” homepage of the app. Every page of the app will have an emergency button that will immediately call 911 and the call won't be ended unless the user’s pin is entered. The app will be a source of informatoin, giving users the opportunity to select from the main menu information on: how to be an advocate, education on the different types of abuse, general legal information, what to do if you are an undocumented survivor, what to do if you are a survivor with children, and shelters in your area. The app will also have different language options as well as information on interpreters.
