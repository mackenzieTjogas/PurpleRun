PurpleRun Project SRS Evaluation
================================

Nice job on this, a great start.

Some suggestions.

When thinking of requirements, try to be even more specific about what 
you are specifying.  For a project of this magnitude and intent, you need
a few more requirements, and a LOT more detail.  For example, in requirement
5.3.1.1 you specify the given language menu, but don't say what languages
will be included.  This should be in a "will" statement.  In requirement
5.3.2.1 what information about the shelters will be provided?  How can the
user select the given area?  How is the information displayed?  Will an
integrated map be available to the user?

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
