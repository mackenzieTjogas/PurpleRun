# PurpleRun

### 3.0 Project Proposal Document

###### Description
This project is a domestic violence app is a resource for survivors as well as a resource to help educate anyone who wants to learn more about this issue and help the cause. The app will be called “PurpleRun” to avoid causing any suspicions from the abuser. The homepage would appear as a game and a pin would be needed to get to the “Real” homepage. It will have an emergency button that will immediately call 911 and the call won't be ended UNLESS the user’s pin is entered.  
Menu options: Be an advocate/ally which will explainhow to help, where to volunteer, what to know, etc. Information on different types of abuse, General info for all survivors (legal, health, etc.), Information for undocumented survivors, Information for mothers/survivors with children, and Shelters in the user’s local area with their contact information. The app will also have different language options as well as information on interpreters.  

The app will call APIs to gather the information needed.  

There are other domestic violence apps in existence.


###### Justification 
I decided to pursue this as my project because it encompasses so much of my experience at LMU. I’ve been a part of Belles Service Organization since freshman year, and through this I’ve been serving at a domestic violence shelter for a few years. Being able to work with women and children who have been affected by domestic violence has given me perspective and experience on the issue that will help me to make this app, as well as made me incredibly passionate about this cause.  

The project will pull from all of my previous computer science courses, and will challenge me to do my best work. It will have a very wide target audience, which means it will need to be usable for users of all different backgrounds, languages, ethnicities, etc.-a task I haven’t encountered to this scale ever before in my CS career. The app will demonstrate my abilities and the knowledge I’ve gained from interaction design, as I strive for usability, programming language as I work with swift for the first time, 401 as I complete another project but this time individually, and so on with all of the CS classes.  

Although the project will be difficult I believe the classes and internship experience I’ve had so far has prepared me to do it. It will be a lot of work but since it will call APIs to gather information and won’t need a database I believe I will have enough time to complete it.  

Domestic violence is an epidemic in America and it needs more attention then it is getting. According to the NCADV (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence): 
    * 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have been victims of physical violence by an intimate partner  
    - 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have been victims of severe physical violence by an intimate partner  
    - Women between the ages of 18-24 are the most commonly abused by an intimate partner  
    - Approx. 75% of women who are killed by their abusers are murdered when they attempt to leave or have left abusive relationship.   
    So this project and more like it need to be done. Being an LMU student means being a person with and for others, to me this project demonstrates that pillar of LMU.
